### Problem Statement 
## Problem Statement
In Disaster situations,information about the incident usually reaches authorities through traditional ways helplines and control rooms.
However,the Real- challenge begins after that-Coordinating volunteers efficiently and safely.
```
Disaster Occurs
      |-->Public informs authorities via helplines/control rooms
      |-->Authorities have volunteer support but lack real-time coordination tools
      |-->unverified volunteers
      |-->Resource duplication in some areas
      |-->Everything becomes very chaotic
```
## Solution Overview
* Dual-dashboard architecture separates disaster control (Admin) from execution (Volunteers), ensuring fast and structured response.
* Automated disaster detection using News API combined with human verification, preventing false activations.
* Live location–based volunteer filtering enables instant identification of nearest, verified responders.

* Smart task allocation system with accept/decline logic and abuse prevention through decline limits.

* Automatic team formation with capped team size and dynamic leadership assignment.

* Controlled real-time communication allowing only authorized team leads to interact with admins, reducing chaos during emergencies.
